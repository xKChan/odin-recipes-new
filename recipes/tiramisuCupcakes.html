    <h1 class="title">Tiramisu Cupcakes</h1>
    <img src="/images/tiramisu.jpg" alt="Picture of Tiramisu" class="img" />
    <h2 class="steps">Description</h2>
    <p>
      These tiramisu cupcakes have all the flavor of tiramisu, but in cupcake
      form, including a coffee soak and a mascarpone frosting. Feel free to
      increase the amount of coffee liqueur in the coffee soak to suit your
      tastes—or leave it out completely. Keep these cupcakes refrigerated,
      especially after frosting them.
    </p>
    <h2 class="steps">Ingredients</h2>

      <li>2/3 cup full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/3 cup 2% milk, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons instant espresso powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons coffee liqueur, or to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chilled heavy cream</li>
      <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese, chilled (see Note)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="steps">Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 standard
        cupcake pans with liners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift flour, baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, baking soda, and nutmeg
        together in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, beat butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together with an
        electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs,
        vanilla, and almond extract and beat on medium-high speed for 3 minutes.
        Add in half of flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in sour
        cream and milk, and mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour
        mixture and mix until just combined. Divide batter amongst the prepared
        cupcake pans, filling each liner just over 1/2 full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes begin to turn golden brown and
        tops spring back when lightly touched, 22 to 26 minutes. Cool in the
        pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely,
        about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        For coffee syrup, mix together hot water, espresso powder, sugar, and
        coffee liqueur until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a toothpick to poke several holes in the top of each cupcake.
        Carefully pour about 1 tablespoon of the coffee soak over the top of
        each cupcake.
      </li>
      <li>
        For mascarpone frosting: beat butter with an electric mixer until
        smooth, about 2 minutes. Beat in 1 cup confectioner’s sugar until
        combined. Add in remaining 1 1/2 cups confectioner’s sugar, vanilla, and
        salt; beat until totally smooth and combined. Add in heavy cream, and
        beat on medium speed until frosting is smooth and fluffy, about 3
        minutes. Add in cold mascarpone and mix on low speed until just
        combined. Do not beat longer or frosting will curdle and separate. Pipe
        or frost cupcakes as desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place cocoa powder into a fine mesh sieve and gently sift cocoa powder
        over the top of frosted cupcakes. Refrigerate cupcakes for at least 30
        minutes before serving. Store cupcakes in the refrigerator.
